- The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a Moving Average [[Indicator]] that weighs more on recent points. It reacts to recent price changes more than normal Moving Averages, which give you better entry and exit points. EMA typically is followed by a number, which is called it's 'Length'. Editing this value allows us to depict how much the indication line follows the data (the larger the length, the straighter the line is).

## EMA50
- The EMA50 is a good indicator that allows us to see small trends and price fluctuations within the charts. It's one of the most used indicators, so it's common to see price resistance on this line.
