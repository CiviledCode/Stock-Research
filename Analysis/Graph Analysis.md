# Graph Analysis
#notes 

- Graph Analysis is the process of finding and recognizing proven patterns, resistance levels, trends, and irregularities in graphs using proven tactics and statistics. Nobody can trade with a 100% success rate, but using these methods we can statistically increase our earnings and predict future trends with some certainty. 

**What are patterns?**
- Patterns are formations created by candles or points within a graph that form shapes. These patterns allow groups to create formality in the market and are backed by algorithms and very smart people trying to hold the integrity of patterns with loads of money, so they can manipulate the market and maximize their profits. With proper risk management, we can mitigate the losses taken by these hits and profit off of the manipulation they add to the market.
