# Indicator
#notes 

- An Indicator is a function that prices are run through at a time point to produce visual resistance levels to increase our confidence in making trades. Indicators are also referred to as functions. One of the most common and useful indicators is the [[EMA]].

**Why do we need Indicators?**

- Like I mentioned in the description, Indicators give us visual representations of key resistance levels that are dependent on the price at that given interval. Using these levels, we can make predictions that back our confidence level to mitigate risk.
