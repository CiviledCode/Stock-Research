# Short
#notes 
- Short is a position that you can take within a market. In theory, it's the opposite of [[Long]] due to the fact that you're predicting that the price will fall. When shorting an asset, you borrow an asset from a source and sell it immediately in hopes that the price falls. After the price falls to the desired target, you then buy the same assets at the lower price and return them to the source.


## Examples

- Let's say [[General Motors | $GM]] is selling currently for $51.75, but we predict that the price will be on a bearish trend. We place a short position, borrowing 100 stocks at the price of $51.75 and selling them immediately. After 3 hours the price decreases to $51.22, and we decide to exit our short position. We make ( $51.75 - $51.22 ) * 100 = $53.
