# Long
#notes 
- Long is a position that you can take within a market. Taking a long position means that you believe that the market price will go up, making you money. Taking a long position is acquiring an asset and selling it later for a higher price because you believe it's currently undervalued.

## Examples

- Let's say [[General Motors | $GM]] is selling currently for $51.10, but we predict that the price will be on a bullish trend. We place a long position, buying 100 stocks at $51.10. After 3 hours the price increases to $51.50, and we decide to exit our long position. We make ( $51.50 - $51.10 ) * 100 = $40.
