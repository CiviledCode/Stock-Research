# Take Profit
#notes
- A Take Profit is the level in which we sell out of our assets for our profit. This value should be set at your entry and shouldn't be touched until the trade is complete. If the price of our asset exceeds or reaches the take profit, your assets are automatically sold off and the trade is successful.
