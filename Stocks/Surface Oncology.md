- I noticed a rising wedge pattern in the morning, but it broken out on a bullish trend, causing us to use the EMA50 as a resistance level, before breaking out at the last minute. There appears to be multiple key levels in the $7.00 range, so I'm curious to see how the price reacts to it today.

- The price started below the EMA50 for the day, but continued on a bullish trend through the bottom side of it. I drew the arrow (green arrow) to represent the trend the market could take. If we do go bullish, I'd expect that we would retest on that bottom line at $6.82 before we shoot back on the upside.

- I noticed that there was a resistance point at $7.30 because there had been multiple retests on the line and consolidation in the current timeframe. If our value can bounce on the upside of this, I'd feel very comfortable in taking a long position.

- I noticed after this bullish trend that we had a descending triangle. If this breaks out of the top and has some sort of retest along with a takeover on the oversold mark will allow me to take a stand for a long position.

- As you can see, we retest that zone of support before we shot back up on a trend. I set my take profit at $8.12 because that was the last spikes resistance, and it touched it perfectly. This is another resistance line. I tookn the long position with my entry at $8.04 and closed the trade with a .8% profit.
