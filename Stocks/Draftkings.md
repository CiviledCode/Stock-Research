#falling-wedge #resistance 

- I see a confining triangle or falling wedge pattern as shown above. Since it's setting lower lows, this is a bearish trend, but if resistance comes off of that I'd take an entry position. I'd like to watch the trade when it breaks this wedge to place a stop/long position based off of resistance.

#falling-wedge #success

- Just as I expected it dipped downwards but had resistance. That was an extremely bullish indication, and I probably would've taken a long entry position on that after seeing it bounce back up.

#resistance #falling-wedge #retest

- This is the resistance I was talking about. I saw a dip below the resistance level and bullish candles showing resistance to return and finally breaking out the top side of the triangle. That is where I should have placed a trade.

#entry #long 
- This is the entry strategy I would've used on this trade. 1.5x risk and a stop set at the bottom of the bullish breakout. This gives me a good amount of room to maximize profit. Backtested 100x on $APPL with a 71% success rate.
