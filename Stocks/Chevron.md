#resistance #ema50

- If we can get a bounce retest off of the EMA 50 right off of the bat, that'd be incredibly bullish. The graph clearly respects this level too.

#blow-through #ema50

- The price showed no respect to the EMA 50 and blew right through it. I don't want to touch this until I fully understand shorting on the Stock market.

#rising-wedge
- I noticed a rising wedge on the 1-minute chart after a bullish trend over the EMA50. After some review, this is a reversal pattern, so I'm waiting for a retest on the bottom side before I take a short position.

#short #success #retest #entry #rising-wedge 
- I noticed a potential retest on the bottom of the rising wedge, so I put in a short position with the stop set at the highest candle point in the triangle and 1.5 times risk.
