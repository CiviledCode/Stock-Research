#resistance #ema50

- I see multiple retests on the EMA 50 line, which gives me a strong indication of what indicators I can use to determine the market trend. So far, based off of what I have seen, I would like to take an approach on the market open to see if the price retests the EMA 50, allowing me to take an entry point on a 1.5x risk trade to scrape a good profit for the day.

- On the opening I see we are starting below the EMA 50 line, so I'm interested to see how the price recovers over it after a few candles to place my order.

- The price attempted to retest the line as seen with the top of the candle, but failed and dipped well below the retest point for the morning. I'd like to monitor how the market recovers, but overall I don't want to take a trade on this.

#falling-wedge #ema50 
- I saw this confining with lower lows and resistance on the 1-minute chart, so I drew a line on the bottom half, creating a falling wedge. I noticed we broke out of the wedge on the bottom half and had clear resistance of that. Then we broke out the top half of the wedge and attempted to retest the top of it, but immediately faked out and broke back over the 50 EMA line. At this point I would've taken a long position with my stop loss at the lowest point of the retest.

#ascending-triangle 
- The day started with what looked like a retest on the EMA50, which I noticed fairly quickly. The candles covered within the "red zone" in the bottom were today's candles. After the price retest, I saw highs were at a similar level and lows could make a line, so I formed an ascending triangle. Since then, it's respected the resistance points.

- Price reached the final point and had to pick a side. It faked out on the top and retested before blowing through the downside. Note that the price touches the EMA50 and triggers a bunch of sell orders, this would be a good time for a retest on the upside.

#ascending-triangle #entry 
- This is the entry I would've taken. Stop loss placed above the highest point in the trend with 1.5x risk.

#success #ascending-triangle #short
- Success on this trade. I would've liked to be more confident on the trade because I thought there was going to be another retest, but once I saw the line break through the EMA50 resistance area I knew it wouldn't retest that high since I know this Stock resists a lot on the EMA50. Took the short position for a .55% gain, which in the end only took around 40 minutes.
