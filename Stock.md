- Stocks are an acquirable constant portion of a company or entity sold for a [[Price Liquidity | liquidated price]]. You are acquiring a portion of the company, which in some cases gives benefits like voting on company affairs and in some cases, attending company events. 


***How do I make money from Stocks?***

- Profits are gained by buying stocks at a lower price and selling them for a higher price.


***How do stock prices change?***

- Stock prices will change based off of supply and demand and the profits made by the company. When more people buy a Stock, the price goes up. On the contrary, if more people sell a Stock, the price goes down. There are many indications that allow us to depict if the market is going into overbought or oversold territories.


***What is Stock Trading?***

**What is the difference between Stock Trading and Investing?**

- Stock investing is long term to grow capital. Stock trading is short term to build capital. Think of stock investing as buying a house and waiting 2 years for the price to go up before you resell it for a profit. Think of trading as going through all the houses in your city to find a slightly underpriced house to sell it for a small profit after a few hours/days. The two are very different, so knowing which you want to do before you make trades and standing with one at a time makes the process a lot safer and stops you from making bad purchases.


**How do I know what stocks to INVEST in?**

- Finding stocks to invest in is really down to personal intuition. Think from the consumer's point of view. Think of how the price could go up and how real world events could influence the price. Staying up with the news makes this process a lot easier.

**So where does the money come from?**

- Well, it's complicated. It really depends on 

**How do I know what stocks to TRADE?**

- Finding stocks to trade has a range of different methods, but the main one I use is trading groups and graph analysis. These two combined give me a good indication of what people other people are wanting to trade, on top of being able to recognize patterns using stock analysis. Below are a few good resources for stock analysis:

**What should I do to get started?**

- Personally, I like trading more than investing, but I think it's important to understand what a good Trader does. A good Trader knows very well and understands that there's risk in trading, but instead focuses on how to mitigate loss on failed trades. Understanding that 40% of your trades might end up in you losing money, but you're still making 60% successful trades, so you're statistically profiting in the long run. A reasonable success level is 65%-75%, although better strategies can prove better results. Your first goal should be to at least break even, all profits made are accomplishments in themselves. If you are confident enough in your prediction that a stock will supplementary yield small pip profits, those trades should be made as they give you the confidence and discipline to follow your own rules and strategy. 

- Building on top of that, I'd like to lay down a few ground rules that I've learned are especially important:
	- Follow your own rules.
	- Don't cheat your strategy.
	- Once you've placed a trade, don't touch it.
	- Always set a [[Stop Loss]].
	- Don't sell a trade until it hits your desired [[Take Profit]]. Stay disciplined.
	- Don't rush yourself into a trade. Sometimes you could go days without making a trade.
	- Don't make risky trades on charts you've never traded on. You can't always assume a market will react to indications, so study a select few markets to start.
	- Get other people's advice. Even if it's just reading what other people are trading or taking advice from the news.
	- Think from the perspective of the smart traders working for big corporations. 

- Now that you have ground rules established, you should begin with a paper wallet on tradingview. This will allow you to make risky trades and trust your gut with no real risk. Practice makes perfect, and I still use a paper wallet to this day when trading Crypto. It lets you try strategies you'd otherwise turn down.
