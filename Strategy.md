# Strategies
#notes 
- A Strategy is a set of rules that a trader follows when making a trade to maximize profits. These strategies are typically backtested and proven statistically on [[Stock]]s to ensure profits can be made, but additional backtesting should be done on markets you plan to use the Strategy on beforehand. 

**What is backtesting?**
- Backtesting is going to a previous period in an asset's graph and testing a strategy with previous trends and collecting data to calculate your statistical outcome. It's important that you follow your rules and don't cheat in backtesting, as you're only hurting yourself by skewing accuracy.
