# Markets
#notes 
- A Market is a center that processes the transactions of [[Stock]]s, Bonds, etc. These are physical locations with real people a lot of the time, but they're starting to move to automating the processes. One popular example of a Market is the NYSE. A market more often than not has working hours, so transactions can only be processed during the business day. To avoid this, you can instead use an online brokerage platform or exchange that operates around the clock, although these prices may vary from the real market price, so market manipulation happens more often. 

## NYSE
- The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the biggest Stock exchange in the world. This market lists most of the major Stocks, but is confined to only being open from 6:30am-1:30pm PST. Solid first exchange to start trading on.
